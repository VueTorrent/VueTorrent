## FAQ

### Unacceptable file type, only regular file is allowed. 
- Running FreeNAS? check out [#101](/../../issues/101)
- On an older version? check out [#90](/../../issues/90)
- Other? check out [#10](/../../issues/10)

### Disable/Uninstall
When you use VueTorrent, it gets installed as a [PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) so that it can feel more like an app.
If you disable or uninstall VueTorrent, sometimes you'll see fragments of the VueTorrent PWA stick around, due to the nature of how PWAs work.
Here's how to fix it:
- Open up your browser's inspector (on Chrome, click the ï¸™ menu, then go to More tools Ëƒ Developer tools)
- Select the "Application" tab. Select the "Clear storage" submenu, and then press the "Clear site data" button.
