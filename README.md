## Important Information

VueTorrent is a **WebUI** (think of it as a "visual skin") that uses qBittorrent's API, enabling compatibility with automation solutions like the Servarr stack.

Everything that is compatible with the classic qBittorrent WebUI will work regardless of the WebUI you chose to use, whether its VueTorrent or another one.
