## Installation

### Manual

- Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/WDaan/VueTorrent/releases) page!
- Download the latest `vuetorrent.zip`
- Unzip the downloaded file
- Point your alternate WebUI location to the `vuetorrent` folder in qBittorrent settings

### From Source

- Clone branch using
  - `git clone --single-branch --branch latest-release https://github.com/WDaan/VueTorrent.git`
- Pull changes every once in a while, using `git pull`

If you like to always have the latest and greatest, please sync to the `nightly-release`-branch. This can contain breaking changes though.

### Lazy/Easy

- use [hotio's qbittorrent](https://hotio.dev/containers/qbittorrent/) docker image, that comes pre-packed with VueTorrent.

[Alternative methods - May work for older QBit versions](../../wiki/Alternative_Installation_Methods)

## Development

- Clone the repo
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- `npm run lint` (to format the code)
- `docker-compose up -d` (starts a qbittorrent docker, optional)
- Open the WebUI on localhost with the default username `admin` and password `adminadmin`.
- Make sure CSRF protection is disabled on the target server!
- Edit `env.development` to tweak your dev environment (e.g. fake torrents)

[FAQ](../../wiki/FAQ)

### Localize the app

To help us localize VueTorrent, you will need to:
- `src/locales/<your language>.json`
  - Create a json file containing the translations by matching the structure of `en.json`
    - every key may not be specified, that's fine, it will default to the english locale
  - `<your language>` should match the ISO 639 locale code of the added language
- `src/locales/locales.ts`
  - add your language to the `Locales` enum, it should match the json filename
  - Update the `LOCALES` constant with the local language name and the created enum value
- `src/locales/index.ts`
  - import the json file
  - include it in the `messages` object using the created enum value as key

## Support

Open up an issue ðŸ˜›

but before you do that:

- confirm you're on the latest version of VueTorrent
- confirm there is no other issue mentioning the same problem
