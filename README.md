## Installation

### Manual

- Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/WDaan/VueTorrent/releases) page!
- Download the latest `vuetorrent.zip`
- Unzip the downloaded file
- Point your alternate WebUI location to the `vuetorrent` folder in qBittorrent settings

### From Source

- Head to the [`latest-release`](https://github.com/WDaan/VueTorrent/tree/latest-release) branch
- Clone branch using
  - `git clone --single-branch --branch latest-release https://github.com/WDaan/VueTorrent.git`
- Pull changes every once in a while, using `git pull`

### NGINX install

You can use NGINX reverse proxy to use VueTorrent, without making any change to qBittorrent. 

Simply download and unzip the folder to a location (`/opt` here) and paste this code into your NGINX config file.

```nginx
server {
  server_name vue.torrent;
  location / {
    root /opt/vuetorrent/public/;
  }
  location /api {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8081;
    http2_push_preload on;
    client_max_body_size 10M;
  }
}
```

## Development

- Clone the repo
- `npm install`
- `npm run serve`
- `npm run lint` (to format the code)
- `docker-compose up -d` (to start qbittorrent docker => optional, you can edit `vue.config.js` as well)

## FAQ

### Unacceptable file type, only regular file is allowed. 
- Running FreeNAS? check out [#101](/../../issues/101)
- On an older version? check out [#90](/../../issues/90)
- Other? check out [#10](/../../issues/10)

### Disable/Uninstall

When you use VueTorrent, it gets installed as a [PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) so that it can feel more like an app.

If you disable or uninstall VueTorrent, sometimes you'll see fragments of the VueTorrent PWA stick around, due to the nature of how PWAs work.

Here's how to fix it:
- Open up your browser's inspector (on Chrome, click the ï¸™ menu, then go to More tools > Developer tools)
- Select the "Application" tab. Select the "Clear storage" submenu, and then press the `Clear site data` button.
