## Installation

### Manual

- Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/WDaan/VueTorrent/releases) page!
- Download the latest `vuetorrent.zip`
- Unzip the downloaded file
- Point your alternate WebUI location to the `vuetorrent` folder in qBittorrent settings

### From Source

- Clone branch using
  - `git clone --single-branch --branch latest-release https://github.com/WDaan/VueTorrent.git`
- Pull changes every once in a while, using `git pull`

If you like to always have the latest and greatest, please sync to the `nightly-release`-branch. This can contain breaking changes though.

### Lazy/Easy

- use [hotio's qbittorrent](https://hotio.dev/containers/qbittorrent/) docker image, that comes pre-packed with VueTorrent.

[Alternative methods - May work for older QBit versions](../../wiki/Alternative_Installation_Methods)

## Development

- Clone the repo
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- `npm run lint` (to format the code)
- `docker-compose up -d` (to start qbittorrent docker => optional, you can edit `vite.config.js` as well)
- Open the WebUI on localhost with the default username `admin` and password `adminadmin`.
- Edit `env.development` to tweak your dev environment (e.g. fake torrents)
