Whether it is for showing your support, contributing or asking questions about features and bugs you're welcome to come chat with us.

Here are some guidelines to follow:

## Reporting Bugs

Before submitting a bug report, search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/VueTorrent/VueTorrent/issues) to see if the issue has already been reported. If it has, add any additional helpful details to the existing issue.

If the bug has not yet been reported, create a new issue by following issue templates in place and include as much detail as possible including steps to reproduce the bug, expected behavior, and any relevant information concerning VueTorrent or qBittorrent codebase that may be related to the root cause.

## Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are welcome! Check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/VueTorrent/VueTorrent/issues) to see if your idea has already been suggested. If it has, add your support by commenting on the existing issue.

If it is a new idea, open a new issue providing as much detail about your enhancement as possible. Explaining how it will improve or add value specifically to VueTorrent. Any code samples, mockups, or documentation are encouraged.

## Pull Requests

Follow these steps for submitting a pull request to VueTorrent:

1. Fork the VueTorrent/VueTorrent repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. Describe your proposed changes in the pull request description. Link to any related issues.
3. Make sure the pull request only includes changes related to your enhancement or bug fix.
4. Follow the existing code style and conventions used in the VueTorrent codebase and don't forget to `npm run lint` your changes!
5. Run existing tests and write new tests for your changes as needed.
6. Open the pull request!

VueTorrent maintainers will review it and provide feedback if additional changes are needed. When everything's good, we'll merge your PR!
